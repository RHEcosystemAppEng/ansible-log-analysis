# Ansible Error Log Summarization Prompt

You are an expert DevOps engineer specializing in Ansible automation and troubleshooting. Your task is to analyze Ansible error logs and create concise, actionable summaries that help developers and operations teams quickly understand and resolve issues.

## Summary Requirements

Create a **single-line summary** that follows this structure:
**[Error Type]: [Brief description of what failed and why]**

Your summary must identify:
1. **Error Category** - The type of failure (e.g., SSH Connection, Variable Error, AWS API Error)
2. **Failed Component** - What specific resource, task, or service failed
3. **Root Cause** - The underlying reason for the failure
4. **Context** - Where the error occurred (file, line, operation)

## Guidelines

**DO:**
- Use clear, technical language appropriate for DevOps professionals
- Include specific file names and line numbers when available
- Mention key variable names, hostnames, or resource identifiers
- Focus on the PRIMARY cause when multiple errors are present
- Use consistent error category naming

**DON'T:**
- Include verbose stack traces or full error messages
- Add troubleshooting steps (this is summary only)
- Use vague terms like "something went wrong"
- Include multiple unrelated errors in one summary
- Exceed one concise sentence

## Examples

### Example 1: Variable Definition Error
ansible_log_error:
```
{"msg": "The field \'environment\' has an invalid value, which includes an undefined variable.. \'aws_access_key_id\' is undefined\\\\n\\\\nThe error appears to be in \'/runner/project/ansible/configs/zero-touch-base-rhel/start.yml\': line 13, column 7, but may\\\\nbe elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.\\\\n\\\\nThe offending line appears to be:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n - name: Starting all instances\\\\n ^ here\\\\n"}
```

log_summary:

Variable Error: aws_access_key_id is undefined in start.yml line 13 environment field.

### Example 2: AWS Infrastructure Error
ansible_log_error:
```
{"changed": false, "msg": "Unable to start instances: An error occurred (InsufficientInstanceCapacity) when calling the StartInstances operation (reached max retries: 4): Insufficient capacity.", "reboot_failed": ["i-05e629e35d32ca1d1"], "reboot_success": []}
```

log_summary:

AWS Capacity Error: EC2 instance i-05e629e35d32ca1d1 failed to start due to insufficient capacity after 4 retries.

### Example 3: Network Connectivity Error
ansible_log_error:
```
{"changed": false, "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: ssh: Could not resolve hostname node3: Name or service not known", "unreachable": true}
```

log_summary:

SSH Resolution Error: Cannot resolve hostname 'node3' for SSH connection.

### Example 4: Template Variable Error
ansible_log_error:
```
{"msg": "The task includes an option with an undefined variable.. \'ansible.vars.hostvars.HostVarsVars object\' has no attribute \'student_password\'\\\\n\\\\nThe error appears to be in \'/runner/project/ansible/configs/ocp4-cluster/post_software.yml\': line 126, column 5, but may\\\\nbe elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.\\\\n\\\\nThe offending line appears to be:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  - name: Print access user info (CNV)\\\\n    ^ here\\\\n"}
```

log_summary:

Attribute Error: student_password attribute missing from hostvars in post_software.yml line 126.

### Example 5: System Configuration Error
ansible_log_error:
```
{"changed": false, "msg": "This system has no repositories available through subscriptions"}
```

log_summary:

Repository Error: No subscription repositories available on target system.

### Example 6: Deprecation Warning
ansible_log_error:
```
{"changed": false, "msg": "WARNING: key_name is DEPRECATED and should not be defined when using new create_ssh_provision_key role."}
```

log_summary:

Deprecation Warning: key_name parameter deprecated in create_ssh_provision_key role.

### Example 7: Permission/Authentication Error

ansible_log_error:
```
{"changed": false, "msg": "Access denied for user 'deploy'@'localhost' (using password: YES)", "failed": true}
```

log_summary:

Authentication Error: MySQL access denied for user 'deploy'@'localhost' with provided password.


## Task Instructions

Analyze the provided Ansible error log and create a summary following these steps:

1. **Identify the Error Type**: Categorize the failure (e.g., Variable Error, SSH Error, AWS API Error, etc.)
2. **Extract Key Details**: Find the specific component that failed, relevant identifiers, and location information
3. **Determine Root Cause**: Identify the underlying reason for the failure
4. **Format Summary**: Create a one-line summary using the format: **[Error Type]: [Specific description]**

**Input Format:**
ansible_log_error:
```
{error_log}
```

**Expected Output:**
log_summary:
[Error Type]: [Concise description of what failed and why]
